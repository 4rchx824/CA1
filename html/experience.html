                    I am currently enjoying my life is Poly, the whole class seems very relaxed, and everyone seems to be comfortable and get along well with each other!<br /><br /> My current modules include Fundamentals of Programming, Fundamentals of Front-End Web Development, Fundamentals of Computing, Mathematics, Communication for Project Proposal, Critical and Analytical Thinking and Sports for Life! The photo gallery on the right has some of our group selfies up until now.<br /><br />I have tried joining some CCAs in SP, however, I didn't manage to pass my Basketball and Badminton trials as they were very hard. Therefore, I am considering joining SOCA, SOCC or SEED. I have currently participated in one event within SP which is the One Heart Service-Learning Event! The 2nd wide picture depicts my group during the bonding day! <br /><br />
