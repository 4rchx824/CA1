                    Upon graduation from Singapore Polytechnic, one of my career option is to be a Software Engineer. The job of a software engineer is to design and create computer systems and applications in order to solve real-world problems. Essentially, Software Engineers create software for computers and applications. This careeer option truly reflects the reason why I had chose to join DIT in the first place; in order to solve real-world problems.

                    Successful engineers know how to use the right programming languages, platforms, and architectures to develop everything from computer games to network control systems. In addition to building their own systems, software engineers also test, improve, and maintain software built by other engineers.

                    Another career option that I can consider is a DevOps Engineer. A DevOps Engineer is responsible for optimizing an organization's software, including software maintenance and server administration. Essentially a DevOps Engineer's end goal is to ultimately shorten the software development cycle hence increasing the frequency of updates, allowing more dependable releases.

                    <br /><br />
                    Additional skills that a DevOps Engineer should understand include Project Management, Coding and Server administration.

                    A career option that also seems to be interesting to me is a UI Designer. Whenever you access a website or an app on your phone, there's usually a graphical interface that allows you to navigate. UI Designers create the elements and layouts that facilitate your actions. 
                    
                    <br /><br />

                    However, while creating visually pleasing interfaces are important, UI extends way beyond that. When you're using an application, it should be intuitive. The interface should also be accessible and inclusive, users should be able to operate and understand the interface regardless of their ability, age, race, gender identity, or background.
